    # Storing Credentials as a Kubernetes Secret

    AWS credentials may be supplied as a Kubernetes `Secret`. Credentials will
    be stored in this control plane and will only be accessible to installed
    providers.

    Credentials should be provided in the following format:
    ```
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = <aws_access_key>
    aws_secret_access_key = <aws_secret_key>
    ```

    See the [AWS
    documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html#cli-configure-quickstart-creds)
    for more information on how to generate credentials.

    # OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    
    Using OIDC to authenticate to AWS eliminates the need to store credentials
    in this control plane. Instead, you will need to add Upbound as an identity
    provider in your AWS account, then create an IAM role that the AWS provider
    in your control plane can assume. Go through the following steps to add the
    identity provider.
    1. Open the IAM console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam').
    2. Navigate to **Identity Providers** > **Add Provider** and select **OpenID Connect**.
    3. Use `https://proidc.upbound.io` as the **Provider URL** and `sts.amazonaws.com` as the **Audience**.
    4. Select **Add Provider**.

    With an identity provider created, multiple roles may be associated, each
    with its own permissions and identity validation. Go through the following
    steps to acquire the ARN for a role that allows the AWS provider your
    control plane to assume its permissions.
    1. Navigate to **Roles**.
    2. Select an existing role or create a new one.
    3. Select **Custom trust policy**.
    4. Author a trust policy. An example is shown below.
    ```
    {
       "Version":"2012-10-17",
       "Statement":[
          {
             "Effect":"Allow",
             "Principal":{
                "Federated":"arn:aws:iam::YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID:oidc-provider/proidc.upbound.io"
             },
             "Action":"sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
             "Condition":{
                "StringEquals":{
                   "proidc.upbound.io:sub":"mcp:YOUR_UPBOUND_ACCOUNT/YOUR_CONTROL_PLANE:provider:provider-aws",
                   "proidc.upbound.io:aud":"sts.amazonaws.com"
                }
             }
          }
       ]
    }
    ```
    5. Add the desired permissions.
    6. Create role.

    Copy the ARN from the **Summary** section of the role into the input.
