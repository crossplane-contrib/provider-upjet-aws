                            strongly recommended to limit who has the ability to invoke
                            UpdateUserIdentityInfo. Someone with that ability can
                            change the login credentials of other users by changing
                            their email address. This poses a security risk to your
                            organization. They can change the email address of a user
                            to the attacker's email address, and then reset the password
                            through email. For more information, see Best Practices
