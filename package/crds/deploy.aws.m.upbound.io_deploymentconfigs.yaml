                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                              represents the minimum number of healthy instances as
                              a percentage of the total number of instances in the
                              Availability Zone during a deployment. If you specify
                              FLEET_PERCENT, at the start of the deployment, AWS CodeDeploy
                              converts the percentage to the equivalent number of
                              instance and rounds up fractional instances. When the
                              type is HOST_COUNT, the value represents the minimum
                              number of healthy instances in the Availability Zone
                              as an absolute value.

                          specify a monitor_duration_in_seconds, CodeDeploy starts
                          deploying to the next Availability Zone immediately.
