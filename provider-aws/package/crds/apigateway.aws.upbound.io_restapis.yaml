                      of its value when present in a configuration. It is recommended
                      to use the aws_api_gateway_rest_api_policy resource instead.
                      If importing an OpenAPI specification via the body argument,
                      this corresponds to the x-amazon-apigateway-policy extension.
                      If the argument value is provided and is different than the
                      OpenAPI value, the argument value will override the OpenAPI
