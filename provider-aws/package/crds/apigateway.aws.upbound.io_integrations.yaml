                      . For AWS integrations, the URI should be of the form arn:aws:apigateway:{region}:{subdomain.service|service}:{path|action}/{service_api}.
                      region, subdomain and service are used to determine the right
                      endpoint. e.g., arn:aws:apigateway:eu-west-1:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/arn:aws:lambda:eu-west-1:012345678901:function:my-func/invocations.
                      For private integrations, the URI parameter is not used for
                      routing requests to your endpoint, but is used for setting the
                      Host header and for certificate validation.
