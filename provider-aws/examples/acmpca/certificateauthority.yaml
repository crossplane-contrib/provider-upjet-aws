# Excerpt from https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/acmpca_certificate_authority
# Creating this resource will leave the certificate authority in a PENDING_CERTIFICATE status, which means it cannot yet issue certificates. To complete this setup, you must fully sign the certificate authority CSR available in the certificate_signing_request attribute and import the signed certificate outside of Terraform. Terraform can support another resource to manage that workflow automatically in the future.
