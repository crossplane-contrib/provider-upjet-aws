# note(aru): This example manifest was not initially working due to invalid
# instance class,engine version combination. I don't know whether this was
# already the case when the example manifest was first introduced, or
# this was the result of a change (for supported combinations) on the
# AWS side. If this is on the AWS side, then we had better use the
# manual-intervention annotation, but I suspect this was not working
# so I did not mark this resource to be skipped.
