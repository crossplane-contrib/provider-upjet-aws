        # This action uses ~2 operations per stale issue per run to determine
        # whether it's still stale. It also uses 2-3 operations to mark an issue
        # stale or not. During steady state (no issues to mark stale, check, or
        # close) we seem to use less than 10 operations with ~350 issues and PRs
        # open.

          This provider repo does not have enough maintainers to address every
          issue. Since there has been no activity in the last 90 days it is now marked
          as `stale`. It will be closed in 14 days if no further activity occurs.
          Leaving a comment **starting with** `/fresh` will mark this issue as not
          stale.

          This issue is being closed since there has been no activity for 14 days
          since marking it as `stale`. If you still need help, feel free to
          comment or reopen the issue!
